*****************

The Code Institiue student template was used to create this project.

### Hosting Platforms

The website is deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) directly from the 'main' branch. While the static files are hosted on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

The deployed website will update automatically when new changes are committed to the main branch of Github. 

To host this website:
- I created a requirements.txt file using the terminal command 'pip freeze > requirements.txt'.
- Then created a Procfile with the terminal command 'echo web: gunicorn mens_style_store.wsgi:application > Procfile'.
- I added, committed, and pushed the files to the projects Github repository.
- After that I created a new app on the Heroku website by clicking the "New" button in the dashboard.
- From within the new app I clicked on settings --> deploy --> deployment method and then selected Github to connect the app to my Github repository.
- Lastly I added the necessary config vars for 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', 'DATABASE_URL', 'EMAIL_HOST_PASS', 'EMAIL_HOST_USER', 'SECRET_KEY', 'STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', 'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY' and 'USE_AWS' in order to make the app able to run.
